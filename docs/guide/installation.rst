Installation
============

Before installing, ensure that Python ``3.9+`` is available. It is recommended to install the library in a virtual
environment (e.g. using ``venv`` or ``conda``), which is often already created by the used environment library (e.g. 
``Isaac Lab``). If so, make sure to activate it before installing RSL-RL.
