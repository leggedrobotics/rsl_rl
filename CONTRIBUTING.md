# Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community. For new features, we recommend first opening an issue to discuss the proposed contribution before opening a pull request.

## Code Style

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guide for code.
- Follow the [Google Style Guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for docstrings.
- Use the [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) linter and formatter to maintain code quality.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make changes to the codebase.
3. Run [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to format and lint code with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. Open a pull request to the `main` branch.
