# RSL RL

A fast and simple implementation of RL algorithms, designed to run fully on GPU.
This code is an evolution of `rl-pytorch` provided with NVIDIA's Isaac Gym.

Environment repositories using the framework:

* **`Isaac Lab`** (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Sim): https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab
* **`Legged-Gym`** (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Gym): https://leggedrobotics.github.io/legged_gym/

The main branch supports **PPO** and **Student-Teacher Distillation** with additional features from our research. These include:

* [Random Network Distillation (RND)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v229/schwarke23a.html) - Encourages exploration by adding
  a curiosity driven intrinsic reward.
* [Symmetry-based Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04359) - Makes the learned behaviors more symmetrical.

We welcome contributions from the community. Please check our contribution guidelines for more
information.

**Maintainer**: Mayank Mittal and Clemens Schwarke <br/>
**Affiliation**: Robotic Systems Lab, ETH Zurich & NVIDIA <br/>
**Contact**: cschwarke@ethz.ch

> **Note:** The `algorithms` branch supports additional algorithms (SAC, DDPG, DSAC, and more). However, it isn't currently actively maintained.


## Setup

The package can be installed via PyPI with:

```bash
pip install rsl-rl-lib
```

or by cloning this repository and installing it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
cd rsl_rl
pip install -e .
```

The package supports the following logging frameworks which can be configured through `logger`:

* Tensorboard: https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/
* Weights & Biases: https://wandb.ai/site
* Neptune: https://docs.neptune.ai/

For a demo configuration of PPO, please check the [dummy_config.yaml](config/dummy_config.yaml) file.


## Contribution Guidelines

For documentation, we adopt the [Google Style Guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for docstrings. Please make sure that your code is well-documented and follows the guidelines.

We use the following tools for maintaining code quality:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Runs a list of formatters and linters over the codebase.
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The uncompromising code formatter.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): A wrapper around PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity checker.

Please check [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for instructions to set these up. To run over the entire repository, please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# for installation (only once)
pre-commit install
# for running
pre-commit run --all-files
```
