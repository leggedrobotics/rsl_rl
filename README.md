# RSL-RL

**RSL-RL** is a GPU-accelerated, lightweight learning library for robotics research. Its compact design allows
researchers to prototype and test new ideas without the overhead of modifying large, complex libraries. RSL-RL supports
multi-GPU training and features common algorithms for robot learning. The core library, without the additional features
of this branch, is also available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rsl-rl-lib/).

## Additional Features

You are currently on the `extras` branch of RSL-RL, which contains additional features that are not part of the core
library. These features are mostly contributed by the community. For a list of the additional features, please check the
[Extras Documentation](https://leggedrobotics.github.io/rsl_rl/extras/).

## Learning Environments

RSL-RL is currently used by the following robot learning libraries:

- [Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab) (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Sim)
- [Legged Gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Gym)
- [mjlab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab) (built on top of MuJoCo Warp)
- [MuJoCo Playground](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground) (built on top of MuJoCo MJX and Warp)

## Installation

Before installing RSL-RL, ensure that Python `3.9+` is available. It is recommended to install the library in a virtual
environment (e.g. using `venv` or `conda`), which is often already created by the used environment library (e.g.
Isaac Lab). If so, make sure to activate it before installing RSL-RL.

### Installing RSL-RL as a dependency

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl.git@extras
```

### Installing RSL-RL for development

```bash
git clone -b extras https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
cd rsl_rl
pip install -e .
```
