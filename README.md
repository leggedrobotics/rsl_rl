# RSL RL

Fast and simple implementation of RL algorithms, designed to run fully on GPU.
This code is an evolution of `rl-pytorch` provided with NVIDIA's Isaac GYM.

Only PPO is implemented for now. More algorithms will be added later.
Contributions are welcome.

## Setup

Following are the instructions to setup the repository for your workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
cd rsl_rl
pip install -e .
```

The framework supports the following logging frameworks which can be configured through `logger`:

* Tensorboard: https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/
* Weights & Biases: https://wandb.ai/site
* Neptune: https://docs.neptune.ai/

For a demo configuration of the PPO, please check: [dummy_config.yaml](config/dummy_config.yaml) file.


## Contribution Guidelines

For documentation, we adopt the [Google Style Guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for docstrings. We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for generating the documentation. Please make sure that your code is well-documented and follows the guidelines.

We use the following tools for maintaining code quality:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Runs a list of formatters and linters over the codebase.
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The uncompromising code formatter.
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): A wrapper around PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity checker.

Please check [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for instructions to set these up. To run over the entire repository, please execute the following command in the terminal:


```bash
# for installation (only once)
pre-commit install
# for running
pre-commit run --all-files
```
