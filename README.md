# RSL-RL

A fast and simple implementation of learning algorithms for robotics. For an overview of the library please have a look at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10771.

Environment repositories using the framework:

* **`Isaac Lab`** (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Sim): https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab
* **`Legged Gym`** (built on top of NVIDIA Isaac Gym): https://leggedrobotics.github.io/legged_gym/
* **`MuJoCo Playground`** (built on top of MuJoCo MJX and Warp): https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/

The library currently supports **PPO** and **Student-Teacher Distillation** with additional features from our research. These include:

* [Random Network Distillation (RND)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v229/schwarke23a.html) - Encourages exploration by adding
  a curiosity driven intrinsic reward.
* [Symmetry-based Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04359) - Makes the learned behaviors more symmetrical.

We welcome contributions from the community. Please check our contribution guidelines for more
information.

## Setup

The package can be installed via PyPI with:

```bash
pip install rsl-rl-lib
```

or by cloning this repository and installing it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
cd rsl_rl
pip install -e .
```

The package supports the following logging frameworks which can be configured through `logger`:

* Tensorboard: https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/
* Weights & Biases: https://wandb.ai/site
* Neptune: https://docs.neptune.ai/

For a demo configuration of PPO, please check the [example_config.yaml](config/example_config.yaml) file.


## Contribution Guidelines

For documentation, we adopt the [Google Style Guide](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for docstrings. Please make sure that your code is well-documented and follows the guidelines.

We use the following tools for maintaining code quality:

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Runs a list of formatters and linters over the codebase.
- [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

Please check [here](https://pre-commit.com/#install) for instructions to set these up. To run over the entire repository, please execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
# for installation (only once)
pre-commit install
# for running
pre-commit run --all-files
```
